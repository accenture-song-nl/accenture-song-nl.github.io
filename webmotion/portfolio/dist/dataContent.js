Arabica farmers primarily sell their coffee as dry parchment or cherry. Those that depulp their coffee onsite often either mix the pulp with manure to make compost or bury it for several days before applying it to their farms.

About 10% of Arabica and Robusta farmers with school-aged children report that their children help with coffee farming activities, but there is minimal risk of this interfering with their schooling.

Focused on eight regions, Comayagua, Copan, and Santa Barbara, amongst others, this project seeks to train 5,600 households on sustainable production practices, agro-input use, and GAP. As a result, 2,400 households are expected to have improved access to financial services, 2,000 will have access to a $3.03 million credit fund, 3,600 to increase an average of 20% in productivity. Additionally, this project seeks to empower women and youth by making them trainers for their households.​\n\nOur leading brands are also investing in additional activities within the communities e.g. building schools, planting trees, women empowerment.",

Reaching 9 communities in those 4 departments, this project aims to raise awareness on the child labour issue and child protection, promote access to education for at-risk children by offering life skills training to them and leveraging the roles of teachers in educational centers, and strengthen the capacity of communities to protect children by establishing safe spaces for at-risk children and development of community assemblies to sensitize communities on the negative consequences of child labour.
